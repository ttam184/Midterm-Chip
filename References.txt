-Two part video that explained how to have an arduino host a telnet server and receive commands from users who connected to that server
-The code that was broken down and explained in these videos was used as a basis for how the arduino receives online commands
-I highly reccomend watching these videos if you plan to do a similar project.
-Warning, these videos are about an hour long and pretty compact. It'll take much more than an hour to watch since you'll need to constantly pause and rewind.
